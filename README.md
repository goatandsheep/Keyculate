Keyculate
=========

Displays past 20 keyboard actions. Each action includes modifier keys held down, while each key is pressed, i.e. SHIFT, ALT, and CTRL. Also has a unique GUI, such that the exit button follows the cursor.

This is useful for tutorials of certain computer applications.

In order to monitor global key presses, I followed this article:

This project is my first project in C#. I've also never worked with a layout before, so this project is meant to be a simple project to introduce myself to the language and also to work as a tool to help me do tutorials in a Microsoft Word plugin, called MathType. You can see all my notes are done in MathType on my webpage:
